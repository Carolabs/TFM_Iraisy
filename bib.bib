  abstract  = {A formulation developed at the Laboratory of Mechanical Engineering allows robust and efficient simulation of large and complex multibody systems. Simulators of cars, excavators and other systems have been developed showing that real-time simulations are possible even when facing demanding manoeuvres.Hydraulic actuators are present in many industrial applications of multibody systems, like in the case of the heavy machinery field. When simulating the dynamics of this kind of problems that combine multibody dynamics and hydraulics, two different approaches are common: to resort to kinematically guide the variable length of the actuator, thus avoiding the need to consider the dynamics of the hydraulic system; or to perform a multi-rate integration of both subsystems if a more detailed description of the problem is required, for example, when the objective of the study is to optimize the pump control.This work addresses the inclusion of hydraulic actuators dynamics in the above-mentioned self-developed multibody formulation, thus leading to a unified approach. An academic example serves to compare the efficiency, accuracy and ease of implementation of the simplified (kinematic guidance), multi-rate and unified approaches. Such a comparison is the main contribution of the paper, as it may serve to provide guidelines on which approach to select depending on the problem characteristics.},

  abstract  = {Many industrial applications benefit from predictive computer simulation to reduce costs and time, and shorten product development cycle. Computational multibody system dynamics formalisms and software tools have proved to be particularly useful in the simulation of machinery and mechanical systems. Nowadays, however, the complexity of the applications under study often makes it necessary to consider the interaction of mechanical systems with other components of different nature, physical behaviour, and time scale, such as hydraulics or electronics. Co-simulation is an increasingly important approach to formulate and solve the dynamics of these multiphysics setups. In these, modelling techniques and solvers that are tailored to the requirements of each subsystem execute in parallel and are coupled via the exchange of a limited number of inputs and outputs at certain communication times. Co-simulation has clear potential in the modelling of complex engineering systems. On the other hand, there are also challenges. The use of co-simulation may compromise the stability of the numerical solution, especially when non-iterative coupling schemes are used.
In this work, we introduce a modelling technique to improve the dynamic interfacing of mechanical systems in co-simulation setups, based on a reduced representation of multibody systems. This reduced order model is used to obtain a physically meaningful prediction of the evolution of the multibody subsystem dynamics that enables the improvement of the solution of other subsystems. The technique is illustrated in the co-simulation of some examples that include both mechanical and hydraulic components. Results show that dynamic interfaces based on reduced models can be used to improve the stability of non-iterative co-simulation schemes in multiphysics engineering systems, enabling the use of larger communication step-sizes.},
